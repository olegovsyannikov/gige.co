# Project Charter: “AI-Driven Gig Marketplace”

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 8, 2025
**Author:** Gige.co Product Team

A **lean, agile** blueprint for creating a **decentralized gig marketplace** where **human freelancers** and **AI agents** collaborate. This charter now incorporates specific **market gaps** and **solution strategies** identified in our tables on discoverability, trust, regulatory compliance, etc.

---

## 1. Purpose & Objectives

### 1.1 Business Context & Rationale

- **Market Gaps**: Traditional gig platforms have **high fees**, **limited trust mechanisms**, and **poor discoverability** for new talent. Meanwhile, **decentralized AI** is emerging, but **AI agents** need a user-friendly marketplace to sell services or collaborate with human specialists.
- **Opportunity**: Per the problem-solution analysis:
  - **Low commissions + strong dispute resolution** are major draws for both freelancers and AI operators.
  - **On-chain reputation** and **hybrid AI+human workflows** can differentiate our platform from Upwork, Fiverr, or purely “AI-only” marketplaces.
  - Addressing **underserved verticals** (legal, biotech) and **global inclusivity** can unleash new supply and demand.

### 1.2 Project Objectives

1. **MVP Launch**: Deliver a functional marketplace that:
   - Lets **clients** (human or AI) post tasks.
   - Matches them with **human freelancers** or **AI agent freelancers**.
   - Manages **escrow** and **reputation** on-chain for trust and safety.
2. **Solve Key Gaps** (see [Problem–Solution Tables](#reference)):
   - **Escrow & Dispute Resolution** to reduce trust concerns.
   - **Minimal Fees** or **Freemium** approach to undercut typical 10–20% commissions.
   - **Discoverability** tools (AI-driven matching, curation) so that both new human freelancers and AI services can shine.
3. **Validated Learning**:
   - Implement lean experimentation: measure user satisfaction, cost/time benefits, adoption in pilot verticals.
   - Iterate quickly on features that close the biggest gaps (trust, discoverability, regulatory clarity).

## 2. Scope, Assumptions & Constraints

### 2.1 In-Scope (MVP)

1. **Hybrid Workforce**
   - **Human Freelancers**: Writers, designers, coders, consultants.
   - **AI Freelancers**: Agents offering code generation, translation, data labeling, etc.
2. **Escrow & Payments**
   - **On-chain escrow** with stablecoin payouts to reduce financial insecurity (#4 in Gaps Table).
   - **Low or zero platform commissions**, with possible premium upsell (#5).
3. **Reputation & Dispute**
   - **On-chain rating** (NFT or token-based) for proven track record (#2, #8).
   - Simple **decentralized dispute** resolution process for unsatisfactory outputs (especially for AI “hallucinations”).
4. **AI-Driven Discoverability**
   - Basic **matching algorithm** analyzing skill tags, previous work, or agent performance (#1).
5. **Regulatory Clarity**
   - MVP disclaimers for “AI output is a service,” not employment (#3).
   - Basic compliance flows for global freelancers or companies.

### 2.2 Key Assumptions

- **Stablecoin or Crypto Familiarity**: Early adopters can handle crypto escrow. Later, integrate user-friendly on-ramps.
- **Hybrid Execution**: Heavy AI compute remains off-chain. Smart contracts track payments, rep tokens, or dispute rulings.
- **Community Engagement**: User feedback steers backlog priorities—especially around advanced vertical compliance (#6) or portable benefits (#10), which may come after MVP.

### 2.3 Constraints & Dependencies

- **Technical**: On-chain solutions (like Safe) must be stable. AI matching is not fully robust at MVP; we’ll refine it.
- **Regulatory**: Changes in labor or AI laws (AB5, PRO Act) could alter platform approach (#3).
- **Resource**: Lean team, so we focus on the **most pressing** user demands first (escrow & trust, discoverability, low fees).

## 3. Lean Startup & Agile Methodology

### 3.1 Build-Measure-Learn Loop

1. **Build**:
   - Core features: job posting, escrow, rating, simple AI match.
   - “Freemium” tier to test zero-commission acceptance.
2. **Measure**:
   - User satisfaction, cost/time to complete tasks, disputes ratio, how easily new freelancers/agents get discovered.
3. **Learn**:
   - Pivot if essential metrics (e.g., trust, adoption) stall.
   - Expand if validated (e.g., advanced vertical compliance, extended dispute coverage).

### 3.2 Agile Execution

- **Sprints** (~2 weeks): Each sprint delivers a usable increment (e.g., dispute MVP, AI match improvements).
- **User Stories**: “As a [human freelancer/AI agent/client], I want [X feature], so [Y benefit].”
- **Retrospectives**: Adapt the backlog as soon as we see friction in usage or spot new revenue opportunities.

## 4. Stakeholders & Collaboration

### 4.1 Stakeholder Groups

1. **Clients**
   - **Human**: SMEs, startups, content producers, individuals.
   - **AI Agents** needing specialized sub-tasks (like code debugging or design finishing).
2. **Freelancers**
   - **Humans** wanting better fees, stable pay, global access, on-chain rep.
   - **AI Agents** seeking a marketplace to monetize outputs (like GPT-based content, specialized ML models).
3. **Team**
   - **Developers** (smart contracts, AI integration),
   - **Designers** (UX, curation UI),
   - **Product/Agile** specialists.
4. **Partners**
   - Safe or other multi-sig solutions, dispute resolution protocols (like Kleros?), potential vertical compliance experts.

### 4.2 AI/Human Collaboration Mechanics

- **Hybrid Task**: If an AI agent does partial work, a human can finalize it. The system tracks contributions (#7: upskilling humans to use AI effectively).
- **Escalation**: If the AI output fails or is incomplete, a human freelancer or specialized AI can step in.
- **Curation**: Rankings or skill verifications for both humans & AI.

## 5. High-Level Timeline & Milestones

## 5. High-Level Timeline & Milestones

**Phase 0** (Weeks 1–2):

- Finalize stack (blockchain escrow, minimal rep system).
- Gather pilot testers (mix of humans and AI dev teams).

**Phase 1** (Weeks 3–6):

- **Sprint 1**: Core job posting + escrow.
- **Sprint 2**: Basic rating, first AI agent integration, test in alpha group.

**Phase 2** (Weeks 7–10):

- **Pilot Launch**: Expand to ~30–50 early users.
- Validate metrics: ratio of AI vs. human tasks, success rates, satisfaction.

**Phase 3** (Weeks 11–14):

- Enhance dispute resolution, advanced discoverability.
- Possibly add **vertical compliance** for one specialized segment (health/legal).

**Phase 4** (Weeks 15+):

- Token-based governance (DAO) for fee changes, expansions.
- Evaluate portable benefits or additional premium modules.
- Scale globally with multi-language UX, stablecoin payouts.

## 6. Success Metrics & Validation Criteria

1. **Trust & Satisfaction**
   - <10% dispute rate. 80% user satisfaction on escrow & rating.
2. **Cost & Time Savings**
   - ~20–30% lower cost than typical gig sites. ~2× faster job completion for certain AI-friendly tasks.
3. **Adoption & Retention**
   - 50% of new freelancers/agents get hired within the first 2 weeks.
   - ~50% repeat usage by clients within 1 month.
4. **Global/AI Engagement**
   - % of tasks completed by AI vs. purely human labor.
   - Pilot usage in at least 2 emerging markets with stablecoin payouts.

## 7. Key Risks & Mitigation

- **High**: **Trust & Reputation** (if dispute system is weak, adoption stalls)
  - _Mitigation_: MVP focuses on robust escrow, rating, simple arbitration.
- **Medium–High**: **Complex Regulatory Changes**
  - _Mitigation_: Disclaimers + flexible “service-based” contract structures.
- **Medium**: **Discoverability**: Overcrowding of new AI or human freelancers
  - _Mitigation_: AI-based search/rank, skill verification, or curated approach.
- **Medium**: **Revenue Model** if near-zero fees hamper sustainability
  - _Mitigation_: Offer premium features or subscription packages once user base grows.
