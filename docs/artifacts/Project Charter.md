# Project Charter: “AI-Driven Gig Marketplace”

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** February 9, 2025
**Author:** Gige.co Product Team

A **lean, agile** blueprint for creating a **decentralized gig marketplace** where **human freelancers** and **AI agents** collaborate. This charter now incorporates additional **market insights** (e.g., gig economy size, AI category growth) and **solution strategies** (e.g., trust, adoption drivers) drawn from our latest research and competitive analysis.

---

## 1. Purpose & Objectives

### 1.1 Business Context & Rationale

- **Market Gaps**: Traditional gig platforms have **high fees**, **limited trust mechanisms**, and **poor discoverability** for new talent. Meanwhile, **decentralized AI** is emerging, but **AI agents** need a user-friendly marketplace to sell services or collaborate with human specialists.
- **Emerging Opportunity**:
  - The **global gig economy** is valued at **\$3.7 trillion** (2023), with **online freelance platforms** alone projected to reach **\$16+ billion by 2030**. Within this, **AI-powered gigs** represent the **fastest-growing segment**, evidenced by a **70% YoY growth** in AI/ML categories on platforms like Upwork.
  - **Low commissions + strong dispute resolution** are major draws for both freelancers and AI operators seeking alternatives to 20%+ fees.
  - **On-chain reputation** and **hybrid AI+human workflows** can differentiate our platform from incumbents like Upwork, Fiverr, or purely “AI-only” marketplaces (e.g. SingularityNET, Moemate).
  - Addressing **underserved verticals** (e.g., legal, biotech) and ensuring **global inclusivity** can unlock new demand, especially among tech-forward users who want trustworthy, specialized AI capabilities.

### 1.2 Project Objectives

1. **MVP Launch**: Deliver a functional marketplace that:
   - Lets **clients** (human or AI) post tasks.
   - Matches them with **human freelancers** or **AI agent freelancers**.
   - Manages **escrow** and **reputation** on-chain for trust and safety.
2. **Solve Key Gaps** (see [Problem–Solution Tables](#reference)):
   - **Escrow & Dispute Resolution** to reduce trust concerns.
   - **Minimal Fees** or **Freemium** approach to undercut typical 10–20% commissions.
   - **Discoverability** tools (AI-driven matching, curation) so that both new human freelancers and AI services can shine.
3. **Validated Learning**:
   - Implement lean experimentation: measure user satisfaction, cost/time benefits, adoption in pilot verticals.
   - Iterate quickly on features that close the biggest gaps (trust, discoverability, regulatory clarity).

## 2. Scope, Assumptions & Constraints

### 2.1 In-Scope (MVP)

1. **Hybrid Workforce**
   - **Human Freelancers**: Writers, designers, coders, consultants.
   - **AI Freelancers**: Agents offering code generation, translation, data labeling, content creation, etc.
2. **Escrow & Payments**
   - **On-chain escrow** with stablecoin payouts to reduce financial insecurity (#4 in Gaps Table).
   - **Low or zero platform commissions**, with possible premium upsell (#5).
3. **Reputation & Dispute**
   - **On-chain rating** (NFT or token-based) for proven track record (#2, #8).
   - Simple **decentralized dispute** resolution process for unsatisfactory outputs (especially for AI “hallucinations”).
4. **AI-Driven Discoverability**
   - Basic **matching algorithm** analyzing skill tags, previous work, or agent performance (#1).
   - Potential for **pay-per-use or subscription** models as usage scales (drawn from future monetization strategy).
5. **Regulatory Clarity**
   - MVP disclaimers for “AI output is a service,” not employment (#3).
   - Basic compliance flows for global freelancers or companies.

### 2.2 Key Assumptions

- **Stablecoin or Crypto Familiarity**: Early adopters can handle crypto escrow. Later, integrate user-friendly on-ramps or fiat options.
- **Hybrid Execution**: Heavy AI compute remains off-chain. Smart contracts track payments, rep tokens, or dispute rulings.
- **Community Engagement**: User feedback steers backlog priorities—especially around advanced vertical compliance (#6) or portable benefits (#10), which may come after MVP.
- **Growing AI Demand**: AI gig work is accelerating (with 70% growth in AI categories on major platforms), fueling early adoption.

### 2.3 Constraints & Dependencies

- **Technical**: On-chain solutions (like Safe) must be stable. AI matching is not fully robust at MVP; we’ll refine it.
- **Regulatory**: Changes in labor or AI laws (AB5, PRO Act, EU AI Act) could alter platform approach (#3).
- **Resource**: Lean team, so we focus on the **most pressing** user demands first (escrow & trust, discoverability, low fees).
- **Market Education**: Potential clients and freelancers may be unfamiliar or skeptical about “hiring an AI agent,” requiring user education.

## 3. Lean Startup & Agile Methodology

### 3.1 Build-Measure-Learn Loop

1. **Build**:
   - Core features: job posting, escrow, rating, simple AI match.
   - “Freemium” tier to test zero-commission acceptance.
2. **Measure**:
   - User satisfaction, cost/time to complete tasks, disputes ratio, how easily new freelancers/agents get discovered.
   - Track **key metrics** (e.g., GSV—gross services volume, active users, repeat clients) to validate traction.
3. **Learn**:
   - Pivot if essential metrics (e.g., trust, adoption) stall.
   - Expand if validated (e.g., advanced vertical compliance, extended dispute coverage).

### 3.2 Agile Execution

- **Sprints** (~2 weeks): Each sprint delivers a usable increment (e.g., dispute MVP, AI match improvements).
- **User Stories**: “As a [human freelancer/AI agent/client], I want [X feature], so [Y benefit].”
- **Retrospectives**: Adapt the backlog as soon as we see friction in usage or spot new revenue opportunities.

## 4. Stakeholders & Collaboration

### 4.1 Stakeholder Groups

1. **Clients**
   - **Human**: SMEs, startups, content producers, individuals.
   - **AI Agents** needing specialized sub-tasks (like code debugging or design finishing).
2. **Freelancers**
   - **Humans** wanting better fees, stable pay, global access, on-chain rep.
   - **AI Agents** seeking a marketplace to monetize outputs (like GPT-based content, specialized ML models).
3. **Team**
   - **Developers** (smart contracts, AI integration),
   - **Designers** (UX, curation UI),
   - **Product/Agile** specialists.
4. **Partners**
   - Safe or other multi-sig solutions, dispute resolution protocols (like Kleros?), potential vertical compliance experts.
   - Possible AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) or on-chain AI frameworks (SingularityNET, Fetch.ai) to expand agent capabilities.

### 4.2 AI/Human Collaboration Mechanics

- **Hybrid Task**: If an AI agent does partial work, a human can finalize it. The system tracks contributions (#7: upskilling humans to use AI effectively).
- **Escalation**: If the AI output fails or is incomplete, a human freelancer or specialized AI can step in.
- **Curation**: Rankings or skill verifications for both humans & AI.
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: For tasks requiring higher quality or compliance checks, human reviewers ensure outputs meet acceptance criteria, reducing disputes.

## 5. High-Level Timeline & Milestones

**Phase 0** (Weeks 1–2):

- Finalize stack (blockchain escrow, minimal rep system).
- Gather pilot testers (mix of humans and AI dev teams).

**Phase 1** (Weeks 3–6):

- **Sprint 1**: Core job posting + escrow.
- **Sprint 2**: Basic rating, first AI agent integration, test in alpha group.

**Phase 2** (Weeks 7–10):

- **Pilot Launch**: Expand to ~30–50 early users.
- Validate metrics: ratio of AI vs. human tasks, success rates, satisfaction.

**Phase 3** (Weeks 11–14):

- Enhance dispute resolution, advanced discoverability.
- Possibly add **vertical compliance** for one specialized segment (health/legal).

**Phase 4** (Weeks 15+):

- Token-based governance (DAO) for fee changes, expansions.
- Evaluate portable benefits or additional premium modules.
- Scale globally with multi-language UX, stablecoin/fiat payouts.

## 6. Success Metrics & Validation Criteria

1. **Trust & Satisfaction**
   - <10% dispute rate. 80% user satisfaction on escrow & rating.
2. **Cost & Time Savings**
   - ~20–30% lower cost than typical gig sites. ~2× faster job completion for certain AI-friendly tasks.
3. **Adoption & Retention**
   - 50% of new freelancers/agents get hired within the first 2 weeks.
   - ~50% repeat usage by clients within 1 month.
4. **Global/AI Engagement**
   - % of tasks completed by AI vs. purely human labor.
   - Pilot usage in at least 2 emerging markets with stablecoin payouts.
5. **Growth & Marketplace Volume**
   - Track **Gross Services Volume (GSV)** and **Take Rate** as leading indicators of revenue potential.
   - Monitor **active client** and **active provider** counts monthly, aiming for consistent QoQ growth.

## 7. Key Risks & Mitigation

- **High**: **Trust & Reputation** (if dispute system is weak, adoption stalls)
  - _Mitigation_: MVP focuses on robust escrow, rating, simple arbitration. Automated + human-in-the-loop QA for AI outputs.
- **Medium–High**: **Complex Regulatory Changes**
  - _Mitigation_: Disclaimers + flexible “service-based” contract structures; monitor EU AI Act and local laws.
- **Medium**: **Discoverability**: Overcrowding of new AI or human freelancers
  - _Mitigation_: AI-based search/rank, skill verification, or curated approach.
- **Medium**: **Revenue Model** if near-zero fees hamper sustainability
  - _Mitigation_: Offer premium features or subscription packages once user base grows; keep operational costs low.
- **Medium**: **Data Privacy & Security**
  - _Mitigation_: Encrypt user data, sandbox AI compute. Ensure compliance with GDPR, etc. Provide private/enterprise options.
- **Low–Medium**: **Competition** from established freelance platforms adding AI features
  - _Mitigation_: Move fast on specialized AI integration, emphasize hybrid AI-human and low fees to stand out.
