# Budget & Cost Estimate (High AI Automation)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 8, 2025
**Author:** Gige.co Product Team

Below is a budget estimate, **factoring in that much of the development and QA work will be handled by AI agents** rather than large human teams. While human oversight remains essential, we assume a substantial reduction in traditional personnel costs, offset by **increased AI usage fees** and some specialized roles for **AI supervision** and integration.

## 1. Revised Cost Breakdown & Assumptions

### 1.1 Human Resources (Reduced via AI Agents)

| Role/Function                 | Scope / Assumption                                                                                           | Monthly Estimate\* |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Lead Developer**            | Oversees AI-generated code, architecture decisions, integration of smart contracts + AI agents (1 full-time) | \$8k – \$12k       |
| **AI Integration Specialist** | Manages AI model pipelines, prompt-engineering, ensures code generation quality (1 full-time)                | \$6k – \$10k       |
| **Scrum Master / PM**         | Agile ceremonies, backlog management, ensuring high-level sprint direction (1 part-time possible)            | \$4k – \$7k        |
| **Design/UX**                 | 1 designer focusing on UX flows, interactions with AI-driven features                                        | \$5k – \$8k        |
| **QA Oversight**              | Primarily monitors AI-based test automation + final acceptance checks (1 part-time)                          | \$3k – \$5k        |
| **Business Ops / Finance**    | Part-time financial analyst (cost tracking, stablecoin reconciliation, AI cost governance)                   | \$3k – \$5k        |

\* _All monthly costs assume base salaries + overhead. Actuals will vary by location and experience._

> **Key Reduction**:
>
> - We are not staffing a large dev team; **AI agents** handle a significant portion of coding and routine QA.
> - Human roles primarily **guide, integrate, and supervise** AI outputs.

### 1.2 Tools & Infrastructure

1. **AI-Driven Dev & QA Services**

   - **Generative AI Code Tools** (e.g. GPT-4, Copilot, Code LLM): \$2k – \$5k/month
   - **AI Testing / QA Tools**: \$2k – \$4k/month
     > As we rely more on AI for coding and test generation, we expect higher subscription tiers or usage-based costs.

2. **Blockchain & Smart Contracts**

   - **Smart Contract Audits**: \$15k – \$30k (one-time per major release)
   - **Mainnet / L2 Deployment & Gas**: \$2k – \$5k/month (depends on transaction volume)

3. **Cloud Compute / AI Hosting**

   - **GPU or Cloud AI Model Hosting**: \$5k – \$12k/month (increased from original because AI usage is more intense)
   - **Data Storage (S3/IPFS/Safe)**: \$1k – \$2k/month

4. **Collaboration & Misc. Tools**
   - Project management (Jira), Slack/Zoom, design tools (Figma): \$1k – \$2k/month

### 1.3 Marketing & User Acquisition

- **Minimum Viable Marketing (MVP Phase)**

  - Organic outreach, social, developer/AI communities
  - \$3k – \$5k/month

- **Growth Campaigns (Post-MVP Traction)**
  - Online ads, influencer campaigns, enterprise outreach
  - \$10k – \$20k/month once traction is validated

### 1.4 Contingencies (Legal, Compliance)

- **Legal Counsel** (contracts, IP disclaimers for AI-generated code/work): \$3k – \$6k/month
- Additional compliance or specialized vertical audits: \$10k – \$20k if needed

### 1.5 Net Cost Savings from AI Autonomy

- **Reduced Headcount**: Replaces multiple full-time dev roles and manual testers with AI automation.
- **Faster Iterations**: AI-generated code can cut dev cycle times, although humans must still review outputs for correctness and security.

> **Note**: While cost savings on salaries are significant, **AI usage fees** (model subscriptions, GPU time) rise accordingly. Overall, we expect a net reduction in monthly burn compared to a fully human dev team.

## 2. Iterative/Agile Budget Approach

### Phase 0 – **MVP Build & Validation** (Months 1–3)

**Focus**:

- Build core marketplace + minimal AI integration with fewer human dev hours, replaced by generative AI coding
- Basic QA checks also automated by AI test scripts
- Limited marketing (mostly organic)

**Monthly Burn Estimate**: ~\$40k – \$60k

- **Human roles**: \$25k–\$35k combined
- **AI usage**: \$7k–\$12k (generative code + QA)
- **Cloud + Tools**: ~\$3k–\$6k
- **Minimal Marketing**: ~\$3k–\$5k

**Total Phase 0 (3 months)**: **\$120k – \$180k**

### Phase 1 – **Early Traction & Feature Expansion** (Months 4–6)

**Focus**:

- Extend AI-based capabilities (dispute triage, more advanced matching logic)
- Integrate robust user flows (messaging, improved escrow)
- Begin moderate marketing to attract initial user base

**Monthly Burn Estimate**: ~\$55k – \$75k

- **Human roles**: \$30k–\$40k
- **AI usage**: \$10k–\$15k
- **Cloud + Tools**: \$5k–\$8k
- **Marketing**: \$10k–\$12k

**Total Phase 1 (3 months)**: **\$165k – \$225k**

### Phase 2 – **Scaling & Growth Optimization** (Months 7–9)

**Focus**:

- Larger marketing push (paid ads, partnerships)
- Possible pivot to specialized vertical or advanced features (token-based governance, complex AI agent orchestration)
- AI usage potentially doubles if volume spikes

**Monthly Burn Estimate**: ~\$80k – \$100k

- **Human roles**: \$40k–\$50k
- **AI usage**: \$15k–\$20k
- **Marketing**: \$15k–\$20k
- **Cloud + Tools**: \$6k–\$10k

**Total Phase 2 (3 months)**: **\$240k – \$300k**

### Cumulative (Phases 0–2)

Over ~9 months, the total projected range is **\$525k – \$705k**, subject to **Agile pivots** and actual traction data.

## 3. Contingency & Reserve

Given uncertainties around:

1. **AI-based Dev Efficiency** (if AI output requires heavier human oversight)
2. **Regulatory / Security** (smart contract audits, unplanned compliance)
3. **User Adoption Rate** (might require more marketing if slow traction)

A **15–20%** reserve is prudent.

- For a \$600k midpoint, keep **\$90k – \$120k** in reserve.

## 4. Monitoring & Reporting

1. **Sprint-Level Cost Review** (every 2 weeks):

   - Compare actual vs. planned spend
   - Use an AI cost analyzer to flag anomalies (e.g., GPU usage surges if AI dev tasks spike)

2. **Monthly Dashboards**:

   - **AI Utilization** vs. **Human Hours**
   - Escrow metrics, marketing ROI, runway left
   - Automated alerts for exceeding budget thresholds

3. **Pivot/Persevere Decision Points**:
   - End of each phase: Evaluate user growth, engagement, revenue (if any)
   - Could scale up AI compute (if adoption is strong) or reduce marketing if MVP traction is unclear

## Conclusion

By **leveraging AI agents** for most dev and QA work, we reduce monthly human salary overhead—yet see higher AI service expenditures. The **net effect** is an **overall lower burn** compared to a full human dev team, especially once AI workflows mature.

**Estimated MVP-to-Scale Budget** (9 months): **\$525k – \$705k** + \~15–20% reserve

- **Early Phase**: Focus on building the core with minimal staff, heavy AI involvement
- **Later Phases**: Ramp marketing + specialized features only if user metrics support the investment

This refined plan adheres to **Lean/Agile** principles—quick sprints, cost checks, flexible scaling—and capitalizes on AI labor for faster, cheaper iteration while **maintaining essential human oversight** for quality and strategic decisions.
