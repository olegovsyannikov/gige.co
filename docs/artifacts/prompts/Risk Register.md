**Gig Title:** Risk Register Specialist (Lean Startup & Agile Focus)

**Objective:**
Develop a **concise, actionable** Risk Register (or Risk Log) that:

1. Leverages **insights from the comprehensive market report** and **problem solution hypotheses** to anticipate market, product, and technology risks.
2. Aligns with **Lean Startup** and **Agile** methodologies, promoting rapid mitigation and ongoing risk adaptation.
3. Addresses the involvement of **AI agents** throughout the project, considering both benefits (automation, data analysis) and potential vulnerabilities (model bias, data security).

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Risk Identification & Categorization**

   - Gather potential risks from the market analysis (regulatory, competitive, user adoption) and from internal technology considerations (AI model performance, data privacy).
   - Categorize risks (market, technical, operational, AI-related) to keep the register organized and easily referenceable.

2. **Likelihood & Impact Assessment**

   - Assign each risk a probability and impact rating.
   - Use **Lean Startup** principles to prioritize the most critical risks for immediate testing or mitigation.

3. **Mitigation & Contingency Planning**

   - Propose lean, **iterative mitigation strategies** aligned with Agile—start small, measure, adapt.
   - Outline how feedback loops and quick sprints help detect and address risks early (e.g., running pilot tests to validate AI outputs before full-scale deployment).

4. **Ownership & Monitoring**

   - Assign responsibility for each risk to the appropriate **human stakeholder** or **AI agent** (where feasible).
   - Recommend monitoring mechanisms (e.g., sprint reviews, automated alerts) to ensure risks remain visible and actionable.

5. **Dynamic Updating**
   - Suggest a lightweight process for updating the Risk Register as **new data** emerges (especially from user feedback, market shifts, or AI performance metrics).
   - Keep it flexible, emphasizing **continuous learning** and **quick pivots** if high-probability risks materialize.

---

### Required Specialist Role

- **Risk Management & Agile Practitioner** with:
  - Proven background in **Lean Startup** risk validation and iterative mitigation.
  - Experience integrating **AI-specific** risk considerations (model reliability, data security, ethical concerns).
  - Excellent organizational and communication skills to maintain a **living** risk document.

---

### Deliverable

- **Risk Register (Risk Log)** in a **concise, easily updated format** (3–5 pages or a structured spreadsheet) that covers:
  1. **Risk Descriptions & Categories**
  2. **Likelihood & Impact Ratings** with clear definitions
  3. **Mitigation Plans** emphasizing iterative, Agile tactics
  4. **Ownership & Monitoring** approach, noting human vs. AI responsibilities

**Instructions for the Specialist:**
Rely on the **comprehensive market report** to identify potential external market and adoption risks. Keep the register **simple yet robust**, ensuring it can be used by **both human team members** and **AI agents** to proactively mitigate threats. Regularly update the risk log in sync with **Agile sprints** and **Lean Startup experiments** to maintain relevance and responsiveness.

### Output Requirements

- Respond with **document text only**.
- The document should be in a **markdown format** that is easily consumable by both human team members and AI agents.
