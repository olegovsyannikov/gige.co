**Gig Title:** Statement of Work (SOW) / Scope Definition Specialist (Lean Startup & Agile Focus)

**Objective:**
Develop a **clear, actionable** Statement of Work (SOW) or Scope Definition for a new product/service that:

1. Integrates insights from our **comprehensive market report** and **problem solution hypotheses** to establish realistic boundaries and deliverables.
2. Applies **Lean Startup** and **Agile** principles to enable rapid iteration and continuous feedback.
3. Anticipates the involvement of **AI agents** throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring seamless collaboration with human teams.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Scope Identification & Objectives**

   - Use the market report to clarify core objectives and expected outcomes.
   - Define scope in a way that supports **iterative validation** and **pivot-or-persevere** decisions.

2. **Deliverables & Acceptance Criteria**

   - Enumerate **tangible outputs** (features, prototypes, experiments) and **associated acceptance criteria**.
   - Ensure criteria are measurable and easily validated by both human reviewers and **AI agents** (e.g., automated test suites).

3. **Tasks & Milestones**

   - Outline major tasks or work packages, including how they fit into **Agile sprints** or iterative cycles.
   - Assign **milestones** tied to learning goals (e.g., MVP release, user feedback loop) rather than rigid completion dates.

4. **Collaboration Model**

   - Identify roles and responsibilities for **human team members** and **AI agents** (e.g., coding support, data analysis, content generation).
   - Propose a communication framework to ensure alignment and easy handoffs in an Agile environment.

5. **Constraints & Assumptions**

   - Document key constraints (budget, timeline, technology stacks) without hindering innovation.
   - Highlight assumptions based on the market report or technical feasibility.

6. **Risk Management**
   - Pinpoint **high-level risks** (technical, market, AI model reliability) with lean mitigation strategies.
   - Emphasize quick iteration to reduce uncertainty or pivot as needed.

### Required Specialist Role

- **Lean/Agile Project Professional** experienced in creating SOWs/Scope Definitions:
  - Familiarity with **Lean Startup** methodology and **Agile** frameworks.
  - Ability to distill **market research** into clear, prioritized deliverables.
  - Skill in integrating **AI-based** workflows and specifying how AI agents and humans will collaborate.

### Deliverable

- **Statement of Work / Scope Definition** (5â€“10 pages max) that includes:
  1. **Project Overview** incorporating market insights.
  2. **Scope Outline & Deliverables** with clear acceptance criteria.
  3. **Tasks & Milestones** aligned with iterative development.
  4. **Collaboration & Communication Plan** including AI agent involvement.
  5. **Constraints, Assumptions, & Risk Overview** with lean mitigation approaches.

**Instructions for the Specialist:**
Keep the document concise yet thorough, ensuring it serves as a **practical reference** for both **human team members** and **AI agents**. Use a **plain language** style and structured format to streamline updates and facilitate **agile, data-driven** decision-making as the project evolves.

### Output Requirements

- Respond with **document text only**.
- The document should be in a **markdown format** that is easily consumable by both human team members and AI agents.
