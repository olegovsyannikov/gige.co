**Gig Title:** Project Charter / Project Brief Specialist (Lean Startup & Agile Focus)

**Objective:**
Create a concise yet comprehensive Project Charter (or Project Brief) for a new product/service. This document should:

1. Incorporate insights from our **comprehensive market report** to inform strategy.
2. Leverage **Lean Startup** principles and **Agile** methodologies for rapid iteration and validated learning.
3. Address the involvement of **AI agents** throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring the final document is easily consumable by both AI agents and human team members.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Business Context & Purpose**

   - Synthesize findings from the **market report** to clearly define the problem/opportunity.
   - Align high-level goals with Lean Startup’s “build-measure-learn” mindset.

2. **Scope & Boundaries**

   - Outline the initial product/service scope, focusing on iterative development and rapid testing.
   - Highlight major assumptions, constraints, or market trends that could shape the roadmap.

3. **Lean Startup & Agile Alignment**

   - Detail how experimentation (MVPs, user feedback, continuous deployment) will drive validated learning.
   - Specify Agile practices (user stories, sprints, retrospectives) for quick pivots or course corrections.

4. **Stakeholders, Team, & AI Collaboration**

   - Identify human stakeholders and **AI agents** that will contribute to each project phase.
   - Emphasize collaboration frameworks ensuring smooth interaction between AI tools and human oversight.

5. **High-Level Timeline & Milestones**

   - Provide an initial roadmap with iterative checkpoints (e.g., concept validation, MVP launch, user testing).
   - Focus on learning milestones over rigid dates to support quick adaptation.

6. **Success Metrics & Key Performance Indicators**

   - Propose measurable KPIs (e.g., validated learning, user engagement, conversion rates).
   - Outline how these metrics guide pivot-or-persevere decisions in an Agile environment.

7. **Risks & Assumptions**

   - Identify critical risks (market shifts, data dependencies, AI model performance) with brief mitigation strategies.
   - Keep it lean—focus on top factors that might impede rapid iteration.

8. **Usage as Input for Other Teams & AI Agents**
   - Structure the document so it can be directly referenced by **specialist roles** (marketing, engineering, design) and **AI agents** (for code generation, data analysis, etc.).
   - Incorporate clear labeling, concise sections, and cross-references to the market report for deeper context.
