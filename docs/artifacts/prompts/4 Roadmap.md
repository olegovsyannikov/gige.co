### Key Responsibilities

1. **Roadmap Structuring & Timeline**

   - Create a **flexible, milestone-driven** plan detailing project phases and major deliverables.
   - Emphasize iterative releases (MVPs, pilot launches) rather than rigid, long-term deadlines.

2. **Milestones & Iteration Cycles**

   - Define **sprint cycles**, key validation checkpoints, and potential pivot points in line with Lean Startup methodology.
   - Outline how **market feedback** and **metrics** will influence each iteration.

3. **AI Integration Points**

   - Pinpoint the stages where **AI agents** will contribute (e.g., automated testing, analytics, content generation).
   - Specify how human team members collaborate with AI for continuous improvement (e.g., model fine-tuning, feedback loops).

4. **Resource & Capacity Planning**

   - Map out resource needs (human and AI) across the timeline, focusing on a lean, efficient approach.
   - Highlight any critical dependencies (infrastructure, data availability, third-party tools).

5. **Risk-Based Scheduling**
   - Identify high-level risks (technical, market, AI limitations) and reflect them in the project plan with contingency buffers.
   - Keep it lean—focus on top priority risks that could shape roadmap adjustments.
