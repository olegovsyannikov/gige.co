**Gig Title:** Blockchain Expert

## **Objective**

Create a **comprehensive yet concise** **Blockchain Implementation Document** that details **how** our project will leverage **Safe’s** platform (Safe{Core}, modular smart accounts, multi-sig, spending limits, etc.) to achieve the objectives laid out in the **existing Project Charter, Requirements, and Other Project Documents**, all while referencing insights from the **market research**.

This document should:

1. Clearly outline the **technical strategy** for integrating Safe-based smart account infrastructure.
2. Align with **Lean Startup** and **Agile** principles, allowing rapid iteration and adaptation.
3. Provide a roadmap for **AI-driven** and **human** collaboration, ensuring secure and efficient on-chain workflows.

## **Key Responsibilities**

1. **Review Project Charter & Requirements**
   - Study the existing **Project Charter**, **functional requirements**, other project documents, and **market research** insights.
   - Validate how each requirement (e.g., user flow, security needs, AI integrations) maps to **Safe** platform capabilities.
2. **Define Safe Platform Integration Strategy**
   - Explain how **Safe** account abstraction (Safe{Core} stack, multi-sig approvals, spending limits) will address project needs.
   - Highlight the benefits and trade-offs of **modular smart account** infrastructure (e.g., upgradeability, role-based permissioning, security).
3. **Smart Contract Architecture & Deployment**
   - Propose an **architectural blueprint** (smart contract interactions, data flow, external APIs).
   - Detail how contracts will be deployed, maintained, and upgraded across dev, testnet, and mainnet environments.
4. **Security & Risk Mitigation**
   - Identify potential **security vulnerabilities** (contract logic flaws, private key management, oracle dependencies).
   - Describe mitigation plans, including **Safe**’s multi-sig features, time locks, daily spending limits, and recommended **security audit** steps.
5. **AI-Driven Operations & Human Oversight**
   - Outline how **AI agents** will assist in code generation, testing, and continuous monitoring.
   - Define a clear workflow for **human validation**, ensuring all **on-chain actions** follow best practices and compliance requirements.
6. **Implementation Timeline & Agile Iterations**
   - Provide a **high-level roadmap** with sprint-based milestones (e.g., Proof of Concept, Testnet Launch, Mainnet Deployment).
   - Emphasize an **iterative approach**—each milestone should include learnings or data-driven feedback loops, informed by Lean Startup principles.
7. **KPIs & Validation Criteria**
   - Specify **blockchain-specific metrics** (transaction fees, throughput, user onboarding speed, multi-sig adoption rates).
   - Show how these KPIs guide pivot-or-persevere decisions during the Agile cycle.
8. **Tools, Environment & Dependencies**
   - List essential **developer tools** (SDKs, libraries, frameworks) required for Safe integration.
   - Note dependencies (external oracles, gas price feeds, token standards) that must be managed or monitored.
9. **Appendices & References**
   - Include any **technical diagrams**, flowcharts, or references to existing **project documents**.
   - Ensure there are cross-links for deeper insights from the **market research** or user requirement documents.

## **Required Specialist Role**

- **Blockchain Implementation Strategist** with:
  - Proven experience in **Safe** (Safe{Core}) or **account abstraction** frameworks.
  - Strong background in **Agile** and **Lean Startup** methodologies.
  - Expertise in **smart contract** design, **security best practices**, and **AI integration**.
  - Excellent communication skills to produce a **clear and accessible** technical document.

## **Deliverable**

A **Blockchain Implementation Document** (5–10 pages max) including:

1. **Integration Overview** referencing the Project Charter, requirements, and market insights.
2. **Safe Platform Implementation Blueprint** detailing smart account architecture and security measures.
3. **Agile Roadmap** outlining key iterations, checkpoints, and how feedback loops are integrated.
4. **Risk & Mitigation Plan** that explicitly covers security and regulatory considerations.
5. **AI & Human Collaboration Workflow** describing the division of tasks and oversight protocols.
6. **Key Performance Indicators** tailored to track on-chain operations, user adoption, and system resilience.

**Instructions for the Specialist:**

- Leverage the **Project Charter, requirements, and existing project documents** as foundational inputs.
- Integrate **market research** findings to justify technical choices, especially regarding **Safe** and user adoption patterns.
- Keep the document **structured and scannable**, with headings, bullet points, and concise sections—ensuring it’s easily parsed by **both AI agents and human collaborators**.

## **Output Requirements**

- **Document text only** (Markdown format).
- Must be **well-structured**, enabling quick reference by multiple teams (development, security, marketing) and AI systems.
- Clear labeling (e.g., “\#\# Section Title”, “\#\#\# Subsection”) and references for easy navigation.
