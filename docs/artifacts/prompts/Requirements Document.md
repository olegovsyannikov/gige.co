**Gig Title:** Requirements Document Specialist (Lean Startup & Agile Focus)

**Objective:**
Create a **clear, structured** Requirements Document that:

1. Synthesizes insights from the **comprehensive market report** and **problem solution hypotheses** to capture business, user, and technical needs.
2. Reflects **Lean Startup** and **Agile** principles, prioritizing rapid experimentation and feedback loops.
3. Supports collaboration between **AI agents** and human contributors, ensuring requirements are easily interpretable and testable by both.

### Key Responsibilities

1. **Gather & Refine Requirements**

   - Derive **business requirements** (objectives, success criteria) from the market data.
   - Capture **functional requirements** (feature-level specs) and **technical requirements** (integration, performance, AI aspects).

2. **Prioritization & Validation**

   - Use Lean Startup thinking to prioritize the most critical assumptions or features for early validation.
   - Incorporate iterative, Agile-friendly structures (e.g., user stories, acceptance criteria) to support sprints and MVP releases.

3. **AI Collaboration Readiness**

   - Ensure requirements are **machine-readable** where possible (e.g., consistent formatting, clear data schemas) so AI agents can interpret them.
   - Include placeholders or references for how AI-powered components (e.g., ML models) will integrate with the system.

4. **Traceability & Change Management**
   - Design a lightweight traceability approach so that changes in requirements can be easily tracked against market insights.
   - Maintain a flexible format that facilitates quick updates during iterative cycles.

### Required Specialist Role

- **Agile Business Analyst / Requirements Engineer** with:
  - Expertise in **Lean Startup** methodologies and **Agile** requirement elicitation.
  - Strong background in bridging **AI/data-driven** initiatives with traditional software requirements.
  - Excellent communication skills for synthesizing complex market and technical details into an accessible, actionable document.

### Deliverable

- **Requirements Document** (5â€“10 pages max) that includes:
  1. **Business, User, and Technical Requirements**, clearly mapped to market findings.
  2. **Prioritized Feature List** or user stories with acceptance criteria supporting iterative development.
  3. **AI-Specific Considerations**, detailing model inputs, outputs, and performance needs.
  4. **Change & Traceability Mechanism** to manage evolving requirements as the project matures.

**Instructions for the Specialist:**
Use the **comprehensive market report** as a primary input to ensure alignment with real-world demand. Keep the document **concise** and **actionable**, employing **plain language** and **simple structures** to accommodate **both human and AI consumption**. Enable quick updates and straightforward collaboration during Agile sprints.

### Output Requirements

- Respond with **document text only**.
- The document should be in a **markdown format** that is easily consumable by both human team members and AI agents.
