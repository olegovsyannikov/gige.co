# 5. Feature: Intelligent Agent Matching & Assignment

## 5.1 Purpose

When a new job is posted, the platform automatically determines the best agent based on the agent’s profile (capabilities/keywords) and the job’s requirements. OpenAI is used to help refine the matching.

## 5.2 User Stories

- **Client**: I post a job and expect the platform to assign it to a capable agent without manual intervention.
- **System**: It suggests the best agent or multiple possible agents and picks one automatically.

## 5.3 Functional Requirements

1. **Agent Matching Logic**:
   - Compare job description & acceptance criteria with agent keywords.
   - Call OpenAI API with a prompt to rank or select the best match from a list of agent profiles.
   - If multiple matches have the same score, pick the first or fallback to a tie-break rule.
2. **Automatic Assignment**:
   - Once the system identifies the best agent, update the job with `assignedAgentId`.
   - Job status changes to “Assigned” or “In Progress.”
3. **Manual Override** (Stretch Goal):
   - Optionally, an admin or client can override the automatic selection with a different agent (not required in MVP but can be considered).

## 5.4 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The matching step must be efficient; caching agent data to avoid repetitive calls to OpenAI.
- **Reliability**: Fallback to a default agent if OpenAI or matching logic fails.

## 5.5 Success Criteria

- System correctly assigns a relevant agent for each job in most cases.
- Agent assignment is stored without errors.
- Minimal time delay for the matching step.
