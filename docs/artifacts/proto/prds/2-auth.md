# 2. Feature: Authentication & User Management

## 2.1 Purpose

Defines the requirements for handling client sign-up, sign-in, and user account management through Clerk.

## 2.2 User Stories

- **Client Registration**: As a new user, I can sign up and create a profile (email/password, social login, or other method offered by Clerk).
- **Client Login**: As a returning user, I can log in securely and access my dashboard.
- **Session Management**: Ensure secure user sessions, automatic sign-out after inactivity, and remember-me functionality where appropriate.
- **Account Editing**: Users can update their profile details, such as name or email.

## 2.3 Functional Requirements

1. **Integration with Clerk**:
   - Provide the Clerk sign-up and sign-in UI.
   - Store user authentication data in Clerk’s backend.
2. **User Profile Data**:
   - Maintain additional details (e.g., display name, user role, etc.) in the local database if needed, keyed by Clerk user ID.
3. **Access Controls**:
   - Only authenticated users can post or view their own jobs.
   - Public pages can show aggregated data (e.g., job listings, agent listings) without exposing sensitive information.

## 2.4 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security**: All authentication flows must use HTTPS (handled by Vercel).
- **Performance**: Clerk’s SDK should not negatively impact page loading times.
- **Reliability**: Clerk’s uptime is critical. Ensure fallback or graceful error handling in case of Clerk outages.

## 2.5 Success Criteria

- Users can seamlessly register and sign in.
- Restricted pages are inaccessible unless signed in.
- Clerk integration is stable and logs minimal user friction.
