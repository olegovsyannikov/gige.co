# 10. Feature: Quality Assurance and Testing

## 10.1 Purpose

Defines the QA strategy, test methodologies, and tools for ensuring the reliability, stability, and correctness of the AI-gig marketplace prototype. This includes both unit and integration tests, plus any continuous testing pipeline considerations.

## 10.2 Objectives

1. **Prevent Regressions**: Ensure new features and bug fixes do not break existing functionality.
2. **Maintain Quality**: Provide an ongoing framework for reliable, repeatable tests.
3. **Improve Confidence**: Allow developers to deploy changes with assurance that critical flows work as intended.

## 10.3 Scope

- **Unit Tests**: Cover individual functions, components, and modules in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Validate that features (e.g., job creation, agent assignment) work end-to-end across multiple modules.
- **Optional End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: High-level tests verifying user flows in the UI.

## 10.4 Test Environment and Tooling

1. **Test Framework**:
   - **Jest** (commonly used with TypeScript/Next.js) or **Vitest** as an alternative.
2. **Component Testing**:
   - **React Testing Library** or **Cypress Component Testing** for React-based components.
3. **Integration & API Testing**:
   - **Supertest** or **Axios** + Jest to call Next.js API routes and verify responses.
4. **Mocking/Spies**:
   - Use frameworks like `nock` or built-in Jest mocks to simulate external services (e.g., OpenAI, agent endpoints).
5. **CI Integration**:
   - Configure in GitHub Actions or Vercel to automatically run tests on each pull request or push to main.

## 10.5 Test Coverage Goals

- **Unit Test Coverage**: At least 80% coverage on core logic (reducers, utility functions, agent selection logic, etc.).
- **Integration Test Coverage**: Test all major use cases (job creation, agent assignment, job execution flow, result validation).
- **Critical Paths**:
  1. **Sign-up/Sign-in** with Clerk.
  2. **Job Posting** (creation, validation).
  3. **Agent Matching** (OpenAI logic, fallback handling).
  4. **Job Execution** (agent API call, response evaluation).
  5. **Result Storage** and status updates.

## 10.6 Test Types and Examples

### 10.6.1 Unit Tests

- **Agent Matching Module**:
  - Test that the matching function correctly parses agent keywords vs. job description.
  - Test fallback scenarios when no suitable agent is found.
- **Database Models**:
  - Validate data constraints (e.g., required fields).
  - Test CRUD operations for agents, jobs, etc. (using an in-memory or mock DB).
- **Utility Functions**:
  - Any transformations for the agent input schema or output schema validation.

### 10.6.2 Integration Tests

- **Job Creation → Agent Assignment**:
  - Create a new job and verify the system assigns the correct agent.
  - Confirm job status updates from “Pending” to “Assigned” or “In Progress.”
- **Agent Response → Job Completion**:
  - Mock an agent’s endpoint response and verify the system transitions job status to “Completed.”
  - Test a scenario where the result is deemed unsatisfactory, resulting in a “Re-submission Required” status.
- **User Permissions**:
  - Check that only authenticated users can create and view their own jobs.
  - Attempt to access restricted pages/routes without authentication and ensure correct error response.

### 10.6.3 Optional End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- **User Flow** (via Cypress or Playwright):
  - **Sign Up** → **Create Job** → **View Job** → **View Result**.
  - Ensure the entire flow is consistent across UI, backend, and DB updates.

## 10.7 Test Data and Configuration

- **Seed Data** (for integration tests):
  - Small dataset of mock users, agents, and existing jobs to validate various scenarios.
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Use test-specific environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY_TEST`, etc.) to avoid interfering with production.
- **Mock External Services**:
  - Mock or sandbox calls to Clerk, OpenAI, and agent endpoints to ensure tests run in isolation without external dependencies.

## 10.8 CI/CD Test Pipeline

1. **Pull Request Stage**:
   - Automatically run all unit and integration tests on each PR.
   - Fail the build if coverage drops below the threshold.
2. **Deployment Stage**:
   - Upon merging to the main branch, re-run tests.
   - If tests pass, proceed with deployment to Vercel.

## 10.9 Roles and Responsibilities

- **Developers**:
  - Write and maintain unit tests for their code.
  - Collaborate on integration test scenarios.
- **QA/Tech Lead** (if assigned in a bigger team or a separate role):
  - Define test strategy, review test cases, ensure coverage targets are met.
  - Oversee test data management and mock configuration.
- **DevOps**:
  - Ensure CI pipeline is configured to run tests and collect coverage reports.
  - Manage environment variables for test and production environments.

## 10.10 Success Criteria

- **High Coverage**: At least 80% coverage for core logic (target for MVP).
- **Green Builds**: Test suite must pass reliably on local machines and in CI.
- **Rapid Feedback**: Minimal test execution time to maintain fast development cycles.
- **Confident Deployments**: QA pipeline ensures new releases do not break major user flows.
