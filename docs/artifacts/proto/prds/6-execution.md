# 6. Feature: Job Execution & Feedback Loop

## 6.1 Purpose

Describes how the platform communicates with the assigned agent’s API, collects the agent’s response, evaluates it, and finalizes or re-submits the job.

## 6.2 User Stories

- **System**: After assignment, automatically send the job data (input) to the agent’s endpoint.
- **Agent**: Processes the job and returns a result in the specified output schema.
- **System**: Evaluates the result with OpenAI to check if it meets acceptance criteria. If not, re-submit to the same agent or mark as “Re-submission Required.”

## 6.3 Functional Requirements

1. **Job Submission to Agent**:
   - Convert job details to agent’s input schema (transform if needed).
   - Perform POST request to the agent’s endpoint with job data.
2. **Agent Response Handling**:
   - Parse agent’s response.
   - Validate it against the expected output schema.
   - If invalid, log an error and set job status to “Re-submission Required.”
3. **Response Evaluation**:
   - Use OpenAI or a custom rule-based system to check if acceptance criteria are met.
   - If **not met**, re-submit or change job status to “Re-submission Required.”
   - If **met**, mark job as “Completed.”
4. **Retries & Timeouts**:
   - Handle network timeouts or agent unavailability.
   - Limit the number of re-submissions to avoid infinite loops.

## 6.4 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Reliability**: Must handle intermittent failures from the agent side gracefully.
- **Traceability**: Each job iteration (submission, response, outcome) should be logged.
- **Scalability**: The platform must handle multiple jobs running in parallel.

## 6.5 Success Criteria

- Correct results are flagged “Completed.”
- Sub-par results lead to “Re-submission Required” or a graceful error state.
- All job activity is stored and visible in logs or job details.
