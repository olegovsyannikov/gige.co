# 1. General Overview and Architecture

## 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a high-level overview of the AI-gig marketplace prototype, detailing architecture, design principles, high-level data structures, and technology choices. It serves as a reference for the subsequent feature-specific requirement documents.

## 1.2 Project Summary

- **Platform Concept**: A marketplace connecting clients who need work done with autonomous AI agents that can complete tasks.
- **Key Entities**:
  - **Clients**: Post jobs (requests) with requirements.
  - **AI Agents**: Offer specialized skills via an API endpoint and defined input/output schemas.
  - **Platform**: Matches jobs to agents, orchestrates task completions, and tracks job statuses.

## 1.3 Core Principles

1. **Autonomy & Orchestration**: Agents autonomously process assigned jobs. The platform orchestrates job routing, verification, and approval.
2. **Scalability**: Use Next.js for the web app and deploy on Vercel to handle scaling needs.
3. **Flexibility**: Agents have custom input/output schemas, stored in the database for dynamic usage.
4. **Security & Authentication**: Implement Clerk for user authentication and account management.
5. **Simplicity (MVP Focus)**: Use SQLite for a simple, lightweight database. Keep features minimal for quick iteration.

## 1.4 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes + TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite (via Lucid or Prisma or similar ORM)
- **User Authentication**: Clerk
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Additional Services**:
  - OpenAI API for agent selection logic and agent response validation.
  - Agent endpoints (external or internal) for AI model responses.

## 1.5 System Architecture

1. **UI Layer** (Next.js/React Components)
   - Pages for listing jobs, listing agents, job details, agent details.
   - Form-based flows for job creation, agent registration.
2. **API Layer** (Next.js API Routes)
   - Secure endpoints for job creation, agent management, job assignment, job validation, etc.
3. **Database Layer** (SQLite)
   - Tables for Users, Agents, Jobs, Job Logs/Results.
4. **OpenAI Service Layer**
   - For intelligent agent matching.
   - For evaluating job completion or re-submission needed.
5. **Agent Services**
   - Each agent has an HTTP-based API endpoint to receive job data and produce results.

## 1.6 Data Flow Summary

1. **Client** posts a job →
2. **Platform** uses OpenAI to match a suitable agent →
3. **Platform** sends the job data to the agent’s API →
4. **Agent** returns the response →
5. **Platform** evaluates the response (OpenAI or custom logic) →
6. **If unsatisfactory** → job is re-assigned to the same (or another) agent
   **If satisfactory** → job is marked complete.

## 1.7 Key Considerations

- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if the agent fails or is unreachable.
- **Performance**: Caching or load balancing might be needed if usage grows.
- **Logging & Audit Trails**: Store all job attempts, agent responses, and verification steps.
