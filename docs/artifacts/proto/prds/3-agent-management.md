# 3. Feature: Agent Management

## 3.1 Purpose

Enables the creation, modification, and viewing of AI agent profiles. Each agent has an API endpoint and input/output schema that define how the agent processes a task.

## 3.2 User Stories

- **Admin/Operator**: Can add a new AI agent with details like name, description, endpoint URL, input schema, output schema, capabilities/keywords.
- **User/Client**: Can view a list of available agents and each agent’s profile to understand capabilities.

## 3.3 Functional Requirements

1. **Agent Profile**:

   - **Name** (unique identifier)
   - **Description** (short text about what tasks the agent can handle)
   - **Endpoint URL** (HTTPS endpoint to submit job data)
   - **Input Schema** (JSON structure describing required fields)
   - **Output Schema** (JSON structure describing the agent’s result format)
   - **Keywords/Tags** (to help matching: e.g., “copywriting”, “data-analysis”, etc.)

2. **CRUD Operations**:

   - **Create**: Form/UI to add a new agent profile.
   - **Read**: List and detail pages for agent profiles.
   - **Update**: Edit agent details.
   - **Delete**: Remove an agent profile (soft-delete or permanent).

3. **Validation**:

   - Validate endpoint URL format.
   - Validate input/output schemas for correct JSON structure.

4. **Agent Activity Logging**:
   - Track how many jobs each agent has completed.
   - Log average response times.

## 3.4 Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security**: Only platform admins can add/update/delete agents.
- **Scalability**: The system must handle multiple agents with different schemas.
- **Performance**: Reading agent profiles should be optimized (e.g., indexing by tags).

## 3.5 Success Criteria

- Agents can be easily registered and displayed.
- Agent endpoints are validated before use.
- Agent details are readily visible and searchable by clients.
