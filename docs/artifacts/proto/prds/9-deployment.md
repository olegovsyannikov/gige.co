# 9. Feature: Deployment & DevOps (Vercel)

## 9.1 Purpose

Clarifies deployment strategy to Vercel, environment variable management, and build process.

## 9.2 Deployment Steps

1. **Connect Repository**: Link GitHub/GitLab repository to Vercel.
2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY` (or use server-side environment variable for API calls)
   - `DATABASE_URL` for SQLite (or local file path)
   - `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`
3. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
4. **Production Environment**:
   - Ensure that the DB file is persisted or use a remote DB if needed.
   - Migrations (if using an ORM like Prisma/Lucid) run during the build or with a separate command.

## 9.3 DevOps Considerations

- **Continuous Integration**: On push to `main` or `master`, run tests and then deploy if successful.
- **Monitoring**: Use Vercelâ€™s built-in analytics or third-party for performance and error monitoring.
- **Rollbacks**: Vercel allows quick rollbacks to previous deployment if necessary.

## 9.4 Success Criteria

- Minimal downtime with each deployment.
- Environment variables are properly configured, so the platform can access OpenAI and Clerk.
- The platform runs smoothly on Vercel with correct routing for pages and API endpoints.
