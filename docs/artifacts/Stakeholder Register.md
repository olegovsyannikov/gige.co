**Date:** February 8, 2025
**Author:** Gige.co Product Team

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the **Stakeholder Register** and **Communication Plan** for our MVP development and early market testing of the AI-driven gig marketplace. It draws on findings from:

- **Comprehensive Market Report**: Showcasing U.S. freelance trends, decentralized AI opportunities, and the need for improved trust & collaboration.
- **Problem-Solution Hypotheses**: Identifying key challenges (payment security, flexible AI–human collaboration, streamlined workflows, minimal fees) and proposing agile, user-centric solutions.

We aim to ensure **continuous feedback loops**, **rapid decision-making**, and **collaborative iteration**—all anchored by **Lean Startup** and **Agile** principles. Additionally, we detail **AI agents’** roles and how they’ll interface with human stakeholders in day-to-day communications.

## 2. Stakeholder Register

Below is a concise register of primary stakeholders, their interests, influence, and role in the MVP. We categorize stakeholders as **Internal** (core product team, AI systems) or **External** (end-users, partners, advisors, etc.).

| **Stakeholder Group**           | **Role / Interest**                                                                                           | **Influence**                        | **Engagement Priority** | **Notes**                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Dev Team** (Human)       | - Build the MVP, ensure stability and feature delivery.<br/>- Iterate quickly on user feedback.               | High<br/>(direct control of product) | High                    | Lean/Agile approach: short sprints, daily stand-ups, frequent retros.                                       |

## 3. Communication Channels & Frequency

We adopt **Agile-friendly** methods that foster quick iteration. Human–human and human–AI interactions should be streamlined, **minimizing friction**.

### 3.1 Internal (Core Dev Team & AI Agents)

- **Daily Stand-ups (15 min)**

  - **Frequency:** Weekdays, each morning
  - **Attendees:** Core Dev Team + AI Agent “status feed” (programmatically generated)
  - **Focus:** Blockers, progress updates, next tasks. AI Agents submit short auto-generated logs (e.g., “Tasks completed,” “Pending clarifications”) read aloud or summarized by the Product Owner.

- **Sprint Planning & Review**

  - **Frequency:** Every 2 weeks
  - **Attendees:** Product Owner, Dev Team, AI Agents’ summarized backlog
  - **Focus:** Plan next sprint backlog, review completed sprint outcomes. AI Agents can highlight system-level metrics or any unusual error spikes in production.

- **Retrospective**
  - **Frequency:** End of each sprint
  - **Attendees:** Dev Team + optional AI Agent metrics/analytics
  - **Focus:** Process improvement, friction points in dev or collaboration with AI modules.

### 3.2 External Stakeholders (Freelancers, Clients)

- **Weekly Update (Newsletter / Slack / Discord)**

  - **Audience:** Early Adopter Freelancers & Clients
  - **Content:** MVP progress highlights, new features, known issues. Quick tips on working alongside AI Agents.
  - **Format:** Email or Slack channel summary; archived in a community forum for easy reference.

- **Ad-Hoc User Feedback Calls**
  - **Frequency:** Ongoing; triggered by new feature rollout or major bug.
  - **Audience:** Select freelancers and clients who volunteer for feedback sessions.
  - **Goal:** Validate usability, glean immediate feedback for the backlog.

### 3.3 Partner & Advisor Touchpoints

- **Monthly Advisory Call**

  - **Attendees:** Technical AI Advisors, occasionally Legal/Compliance if needed
  - **Focus:** Provide strategic input on emerging constraints (compliance, advanced ML features). Discuss pivot needs if feedback indicates low AI success rates.

- **Quarterly Partner Review**
  - **Audience:** Potential channel/enterprise partners, industry supporters
  - **Focus:** Larger product direction, major wins or upcoming expansions. Evaluate joint marketing or pilot expansions.

### 3.4 AI Agent–Human Communication

- **Automated AI Agent Updates**
  - Short, structured text-based updates posted in Dev Slack or project management tool whenever an AI Agent completes a sprint task or encounters an exception.
  - Example: “AI_Copilot_Design completed wireframe analysis. 2 new suggestions posted. Needs human approval to proceed.”
- **Agent Escalation Alerts**
  - If an AI Agent detects conflicting instructions, data mismatch, or repeated errors, it triggers an alert to the Product Owner (and relevant devs) for immediate resolution.

## 4. Engagement & Feedback Loops

### 4.1 Rapid Iteration & Validation

- **Internal:** The dev team continuously reviews AI metrics (accuracy, speed, user satisfaction) after each sprint. If **error rates** or **user dissatisfaction** spike, we pivot quickly—either re-tune the AI or revert to partial human oversight.
- **External:**
  - **Weekly Polls** or In-App Surveys for freelancers/clients: “Rate your last AI collaboration experience,” “Any friction points?”
  - Results feed into backlog grooming. Features or fixes addressing top issues get priority in the next sprint.

### 4.2 Integrating AI Systems’ Feedback

- AI Agents log performance data (e.g., time to complete tasks, success rates).
- A simple **Data Dashboard** merges agent logs + user reviews + success metrics so the Product Owner can quickly identify improvement areas.
- We maintain an **Agent Improvement Loop**: If an AI Agent repeatedly fails certain tasks, devs schedule a fine-tuning sprint or reassign the agent’s domain.

### 4.3 Multi-stakeholder Collaboration Tools

- Each project or “gig” has a **shared workspace** (e.g., Notion board, Slack channel) where the AI Agent (if assigned) can post updates or request clarifications.
- Freelancers and clients can see the AI’s intermediate outputs, then weigh in with feedback. This fosters a **continuous feedback** environment consistent with Agile’s transparency ideals.

## 5. Escalation & Issue Resolution

### 5.1 Lightweight Lean/Agile Path

1. **Direct Communication**

   - For routine questions or minor conflicts, the client/freelancer/AI agent exchange messages in the shared workspace or direct chat. Often clarifying scope or re-running a job can solve 80% of issues quickly.

2. **Task-Level Retros or “Stand-down”**

   - If a deliverable fails acceptance criteria, the assigned AI Agent or freelancer and the client do a quick “mini-retro” to identify root causes. The Product Owner or a designated “AI-human mediator” can moderate.

3. **Formal Dispute (Escrow Release Block)**

   - If agreement can’t be reached, the escrow is paused. We have a **Dispute Channel** (powered by an internal or external resolution protocol, e.g., Kleros) where a neutral party or small community jury reviews the logs & deliverables.

4. **Fast Pivot**
   - If multiple disputes surface a systemic issue (e.g., an AI agent is consistently off-quality), the dev team quickly reassigns tasks, patches or retrains the agent mid-sprint.

### 5.2 Critical Decisions & Crises

- **Crisis Meetings:** In rare high-severity events (security breach, massive AI failure), the Product Owner, lead devs, and any relevant compliance experts convene ASAP to mitigate damage.
- **Emergency Revert or “Human Override”**: If an AI agent is producing harmful outputs, a manual override is triggered (the agent is paused, tasks are reassigned to humans) until a fix is deployed.

## 6. Privacy & Access Control

### 6.1 Data Handling & Confidentiality

- **Role-Based Access:** Only the assigned AI agent(s) and relevant team members can view gig data. For sensitive projects (healthcare, finance), special encryption or “private repository” features limit AI usage to a secure environment.
- **Compliance:** We aim to adhere to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR) by anonymizing or tokenizing user data where possible. If a client’s data is extremely sensitive, we configure an AI agent in a locked-down environment with ephemeral logs.

### 6.2 AI Tools & Sensitive Info

- AI Agents that handle user data must follow a “no-retain” policy for personal or proprietary info. They store ephemeral states in secure memory, but final logs for auditing do **not** expose raw private data.
- We ensure **multisig or Safe** (if using blockchain) for on-chain interactions. Only the agent plus designated human signers can move funds or read confidential keys.

### 6.3 Human vs. AI Privileges

- **Limited AI Permissions:** Each agent has carefully scoped permissions:
  - E.g., an AI design agent only accesses design files and can’t read HR or financial data.
- **Regular Audits:** Dev team checks agent permission logs to confirm no out-of-scope data usage.

## 7. Summary of Communication Flow

1. **Daily Stand-ups & Sprint Ceremonies**

   - Core Dev + AI Agents → Maintain rapid iteration, highlight blockers.

2. **Automated Agent Status & Alerts**

   - Real-time Slack or PM tool updates ensure the team is aware of AI progress or anomalies.

3. **Weekly External Updates** + **Ad-Hoc Feedback**

   - Keep clients/freelancers informed on platform changes, gather usability feedback.

4. **Dispute Resolution & Escalation**

   - Lean steps from direct chat to formal arbitration. Quick pivot if repeated AI errors occur.

5. **Privacy & Security**
   - Access control, ephemeral agent data, minimal sensitive info in logs.

By consistently **looping** user input, AI analytics, and sprint reviews, we ensure **Lean Startup** iteration and **Agile** responsiveness. AI agents act as collaborative team members—providing updates, receiving feedback, and escalating promptly—while human stakeholders retain final oversight on critical issues.

## Final Note

This **Stakeholder Register & Communication Plan** aims to keep **all participants**—from internal devs and AI systems to external freelancers, clients, and partners—closely aligned. By following **Agile ceremonies**, **data-driven feedback loops**, and **transparent dispute channels**, we mitigate typical gig platform risks while harnessing the novel capabilities of **AI agents** in a **Lean Startup** environment.
